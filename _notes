Building The Website Notes: 
Basically this is a standard (static) typescript react app deployed via Digital Ocean Apps, which 
deploys automatically when changes are successfully merged into the 'main' branch. 

A series of problems that had to be solved along the way.

step 1) https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/
	yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
	yarn
	yarn start

step 2) 
could not access to push up so get personal access token

Postman: 
tried the post and get method for messages as described on the 'repo' and success. 

next: can I access it from the static app ?
